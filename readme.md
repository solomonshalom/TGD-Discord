## About 

TGD - Discord is part of the open-source service known as TGD (The Great Data/The Great Delete). Using TGD Discord you can delete messages in bulk inside of a Server or DM. Do note that you cannot delete messages of others, The only circumstance you are allowed to delete messages from others, is when you have the "Manage Messages" permission but it is highly recommended to use a bot in this use-case such as [Dyno](https://dyno.gg) or [MEE6](https://mee6.xyz)

I made this tool just for you ❤️ , it would be awesome if you could just click the [⭐️ Star button](https://github.com/solomonshalom/TGD-Discord) at the top!
